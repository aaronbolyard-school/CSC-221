# Proto-typing:

1. Hardcode
	- Add "Scary Room" in code, set values
	- Connect to "Dank Stairway"
2. Simple data format
	- Add "Scary Room", "Dank Stairway" to CSV
3. More complex data format
	- Database, etc

* If you do website with database, frontend (view), and backend (controller), congrats, you're a full stack web developer!

* Take things in chunks! For an RPG game...
	* Make player walk around rooms.
	* Make them pick up and drop items.
	* Make them move objects (chest) between rooms.
	* Etc.
* Split things into sprints.
  * At end of sprint, finish features.

* Written code, but can't test it. Bad!
	* I know that feeling.
