# Notes 2018-11-07

* When Norris means GitHub, he means Git
* Git is the version control system
* GitHub is to Git as Xerox is to copiers
* There's GitHub, GitLab, GitGud, MS Azure, Local
* Most places uses Git; old things like SVN, CVS
	* CVS & SVN LOL
* Pay to make GitHub private repos

## Process
* Make commits to local, push to synch with server
* On local copy, only makes changes to local code
* Have to push to update server
* Make collab on GitHub

### Branches
* Someone works on V1, someone on V2
* After V1, maybe someone's working on V1.1 and others working on V2

* Anecdote: Tony Hawk game where day one patch was entire game

* Branches won't modify existing files; can allow multiple to work together.
* Pull Request (PR) to merge branches
* Fix merge conflicts

* Don't put empty commit messages; put comment about changes!
	* You'll hate yourself if you don't.
	* What happens when you go back to see what was changed
	  in case of a bug?

* Git keeps track of differences (deltas)
	* Branching a 12 GB branch with a 2 byte changes
	  creates a 2 byte branch (plus metadata of course)

* Don't always have to pull/fetch

* On open source projects, there's a lot of features / bug fixes / etc
	* There's a Buildmeister (???) that has final say-so
	* On smaller projects probably just communicate

* **showing merge conflicts on web editor**

## Misc

* Copying/pasting from GitHub is a bad idea
	* Indentation, etc will be wrong

## HW3

* Read chapter!!

### Arrays
* With an array, if you create an array of size 10, it's 10 cells large
* With a list, there's the ability to dynamically resize list using append, etc
* Physical size is the maximum size of the array
* Logical size is the maximum element used by the array

* Story about oil tanker running C++ program
	* Allocates memory up front
	* Has to run for years without restarting or crashing
	* Embedded programming is hard!

# Interesting
* Dunderscore means double underscore

"if dunderscore name dunderscore equals string dunderscore main dunderscore" is...

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
	pass
```

* For bad inputs, throw exceptions. Don't return "null"
  values.

# Next week
* Write interface to class
* A black-box that's empty inside
* Allows easier work / merging
