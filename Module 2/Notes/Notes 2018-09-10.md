# Notes 2018-09-10

* Lists, sets, tuples (collections)
* Methods to perform operations on collections
* `main` to perform options

## Unit testing
* Mr Norris has an instructor for 8086 ASM who graded via
  a unit test; 100 tests, one point lost per failed test
* Unit testing allows testing for errors
* Prevents introducing bugs later
* Helps planning/organizing code
* Divide problem into smaller pieces

* Put the problem in your own words
* Know which parts are important and which are not

* In a top down plan, you go from top down. (Duh!)
	* Start with menu, then operations, then square root, etc. (M1T1).
* Bottom up plan, you go from the smallest function to the largest.
	* Square root, operations, menu...
* Tackle smaller problem first
