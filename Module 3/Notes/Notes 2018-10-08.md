* Classes.
* In Java classes are required.
* Early languages were largely imperative.
	* Only run functions.
	* Break functions down into smaller function.

## Why objects/classes?
* Meld state & behavior (data / methods).

* Anti-pattern: The blob.
	* "This is the class that's the heart of our framework." BAD.
