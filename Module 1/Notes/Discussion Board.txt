Hello! I'm Aaron Bolyard and this is my third semester at FTCC. I've been programming for a little bit prior to school and used a lot of different languages, but for FTCC specifically I've learned Python and JavaScript. Outside of school I've learned or used Lua and C/C++ primarily.

I'm working on a game called ItsyRealm written in Lua. I have a small blog (http://bkdoormaus.tumblr.com) and a GitHub for it (http://github.com/aaronbolyard/itsyscape). It's taking a long time...

The solution to the problem:

print("The Man takes the Chicken across the river.")
print("The Man goes back empty handed.")
print("The Man takes the Fox across the river.")
print("The Man goes back with the Chicken.")
print("The Man takes the Grain across the River.")
print("The Man goes back empty handed.")
print("The Man takes the Chicken across the River.")
